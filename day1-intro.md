## NaijaHacks Day1 Tasks
> Basic steps taken
Firstly, we created the github repository which was made private and then started creating different issues on the repo which attributed to the prior tasks which we were going to do as the hackathon progresses.

> Creating a clear descriptive file
So after creating the repo and attributing different tasks via github issues the next thing done was to create a readme.md file which was actually going to show team members name and role to be done via the on-going project.
